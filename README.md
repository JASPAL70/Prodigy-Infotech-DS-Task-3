📌 Objective

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to handle missing values, explore relationships between variables, and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (handle categorical and numerical features).
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
4. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Visualize the decision tree.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
